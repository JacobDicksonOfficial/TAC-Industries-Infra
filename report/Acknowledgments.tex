I would like to express my sincere gratitude to my project supervisor and lecturers for their guidance, feedback, and academic support throughout Semester One of this project. Their insights into system security, infrastructure design, and professional practice have been invaluable in shaping the direction and quality of this work. I would also like to acknowledge the School of Science and Computing at SETU for providing the academic environment, resources, and curriculum that enabled the development of this project. The material covered across modules such as Network and System Security has directly influenced the architectural and security decisions documented in this report. Finally, I would like to acknowledge the use of open-source software and community-driven technologies, which made it possible to design and prototype an enterprise-style system within realistic resource constraints. These tools form the foundation of the TAC Industries platform and reflect the collaborative nature of modern computing and cybersecurity practice.
